# Space Invaders Slots

This is a coding competency test for MrQ.

The underlying tech is based on Vite, TypeScript, PixiJS, Anime.js, and Howler.js

## Installation

`npm i`

## Running

`npm run dev`

## Building

`npm run build` - this will provide a bundled package in the `./dist` folder.

## Graphics

Almost all of the art is from the resource site [Classic Gaming](https://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/graphics)

## Audio

"These 80s" by [Artur Aravidi](https://pixabay.com/users/arturaravidimusic-37133175/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=182328) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music//?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=182328)

Voice samples and menu sounds from the Nintento DS game [Space Invaders Extreme II](https://www.sounds-resource.com/ds_dsi/spaceinvadersextreme2/sound/9439/)

All other sounds from the original Taito arcade game

## TODO:

An ever expanding list of things to implement or do better:

• Turn the buttons into an actual object that can take a text string and not just be an SVG
• Fix the theme tune playback audio sprite - for some reason it gets stuck playing the main loop but at the length of the intro segue
